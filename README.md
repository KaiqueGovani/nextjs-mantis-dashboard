This is a fork of the free version of Mantis Dashboard.
The purpose of this project is to build up over the original by migrating from pure Javascript React with Vite to Nextjs with fully typed components with Typescript. 
Mantis is a free and open source React redux dashboard template made using the Material UI React component library with aim of flexibility and better customizability.

### Name Derived From Nature

Mantis Logo is inspired from the insect name - 'Mantises' as they have triangular heads with flexible Necks. Also, the name is derived from two popular UI frameworks, Material UI and Ant Design (M-Ant-is).

Mantis has Ant Design principal on top of the MAterial UI React component library.
